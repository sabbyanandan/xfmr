= Continuous Delivery for Data Pipelines

The repo includes the demonstration of CI/CD automation for data pipelines orchestrated by Spring Cloud Data Flow. The demo assumes at a minimum link:https://content.pivotal.io/blog/spring-cloud-data-flow-1-3-continuous-delivery-usability-improvements-and-function-runner[1.3 GA] release is in use. The current latest version is at link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/1.7.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-streams-skipper[v1.7.4].

== Spring Cloud Stream Processor

The `xfmr` (a poor-man's name for "transformer") processor consumes an incoming payload, transforms it (_adds a string prefix_), and sends the processed payload to an output channel for downstream consumption.

You can build and run the tests via:

----
mvn clean install
----

==== Custom App Registration

Once the application is ready and uploaded to a remote repository (e.g., maven-artifactory or docker-hub), you can link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/1.7.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-stream-apps[register] the application in SCDF.

[source,bash,options=nowrap]
----
dataflow:>app register --name xfmr --type processor --uri maven://com.example:xfmr:0.0.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
----

Along with the custom `xfmr` processor, this demo also uses the link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[out-of-the-box] `http` source and `log` sink applications.

== Spring Cloud Skipper

As a companion-server to SCDF, Skipper manages the granular application-lifecycle behind the scenes. You can read more of Skipper from the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/1.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#three-minute-tour[three-minute-tour]. Skipper is configured with 2 platform backends: Cloud Foundry (on PWS) and Kubernetes (on GKE). Here's a sample output of the platform-list that's coming from Skipper, and it is now available in SCDF for use.

[source,bash,options=nowrap]

== Spring Cloud Data Flow

With the out-of-the-box apps and the `xfmr` processor registered in SCDF, a streaming-pipeline can be defined and deployed to the available platforms. In this setup, it could be either Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, or both. For example, the following deploys the `fooxfmr` stream to Cloud Foundry (via `cf-prod` platform account); for which the credentials are pre-configured in Skipper. You can read more about the configurations in the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/1.7.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-streams-skipper[reference guide].

[source,bash,options=nowrap]
----
dataflow:>stream create fooxfmr --definition "http | xfmr | log"

dataflow:>stream deploy --name fooxfmr --platformName cf-prod
----

== Concourse

link:http://concourse.ci/[Concourse] is the CI system in this demo. Any CI tooling that can support configuration-as-code can perform what we are attempting in this demo, too. In this case, a Concourse pipeline monitors the git-commits to kick-off a build, test, package, and the registeration of `xfmr` application in SCDF via the SCDF's RESTful endpoints. Finally, also, the CI pipeline invokes the "stream-update" RESTful-endpoint (in SCDF) to continuously deploy the incremental changes to targeted platforms. For more details, review the `ci` folder, which includes the CI-pipeline as code and the associated concourse-job configurations.

NOTE: This CI pipeline assumes a `fooxfmr` and `barxfmr` streams are running in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes respectively. The goal of this pipeline is to demonstrate how a change to business logic via git-commit would automatically trigger the build, run the tests, and finally register and rolling-upgrade the newly adjusted business-requirement change against the "live" stream processing data pipeline.

You can run the pipeline with the following command.

[source,bash,options=nowrap]
----
fly -t tutorial sp -p xfmr -c ci/pipeline.yml -l ci/credentials.yml
----

Once set up, we can access the `xfmr` pipeline from Concourse.

NOTE: `credentials.yml` is intentionally ignored from the repo. You need to create a file with credentials to set up the CI pipeline.

== Test Data

To simulate incoming data, `data.sh` script generates random security numbers of format `xxx-xx-xxxx`. The script invokes the `http-source` application URL/route in the platform, with the generated security number as the payload in the message envelope.

== Demo Recording

A live demonstration of this was link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6fS-KmN0zI[presented at the Spring webinar]. The demo starts at ~41.25.
